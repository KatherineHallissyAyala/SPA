  <h1>Why incorporate technology into a K-12 curriculum?</h1>
  
  <h2>Inspire Critical Thinking</h2>
  <p>When teachers incorporate technology into the school day, there is usually a project involved.  Projects allow kids to make decisions, require them to present their knowledge in their own way, and necessitate critical thinking.</p>
  
  <h2>Meet Kids Where They Are</h2>
  <p>Kids tend to be fluent users of technology.  Planning to have them use technology during the school day is like letting them speak their native language at school.</p>

  <h2>Prepare for Tomorrow's Challenges</h2>
  <p>If we want to build a workforce that is ready to lead in science, technology, math, and engineering, we need to build those skills from a young age.</p>
